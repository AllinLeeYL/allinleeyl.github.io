      Hi, ðŸ‘‹


      My name is Yilin Li. My hobby is finding new things and giving it a try constantly. This is a place where I'd like to share my experience and ideas.I am currently still a graduate student majoring in computer science. My research interests include program analysis and coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA).
